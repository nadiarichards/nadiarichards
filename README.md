### A little about me
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting very comfortable with SQL

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science at Columbia University and loving it!

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data and statistics projects!

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™d love any suggestions on break-throughs in data science.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about finance, operations and hospitality, happy to help!

âš¡ Fun fact: I've lived in 4 different countries in my adult life. I'm now settled in the USA and have been here for the past 12 years. I love dogs and had a dachshund for a long time (can't wait to get another one). I love everything data related, seriously! 

### My Projects so far
So far I've done one project and working on my next one!
My first project involved analyzing large pieces of Data from 12 CSVs (from WHO, Our World in Data and Kaggle) to get correlation statistics between different socio-econimic factors and alcohol consumption in general and wine consumption in particular. I have background in Holistic Health, so I was mostly interested to see if wine consumption correlates with longer life expectancy. There is definitely more to look into, but what I have found so far is that life expectancy and wine drinking only have a low uphill correlation (both worldwide and in Europe - the highest wine drinking continent!). But both wine drinking and life expectancy are really highly correlated with country's GDP. So the most fitting conclusion with my reserach so far is to say that the higher the GDP of your country, the more likely you are to both live longer and drink wine. Things I worked on in the project were: Python, Python API, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Google Maps API. I became really good at merging CSVs, binning, boolean masks, regression and statistical analysis and much more!
Here is some visuals from my project! And feel free to [go here to see our Jupyter notebooks!](https://github.com/nadiarichards/data-analysis-project-1/tree/main/Finalized_project_work)
